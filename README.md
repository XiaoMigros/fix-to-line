# [Fix to Line v1.0.3](https://musescore.org/project/fix-line)

Re-adds the fix to line feature from previous MuseScore editions.
This plugin was originally written by Marc Sabatella, with me making some edits. Since Marc has not published the plugin, I thought I may as well  (as there is probably enough interest to warrant that).

Compatible with MuseScore 4.x
